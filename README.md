# Snake_Game
Welcome to the classic Snake Game! This project is a simple and enjoyable rendition of the beloved retro game, implemented using Python's 'tkinter' library.Navigate your bright green snake around the dark grey canvas, munching on red food items to grow longer and score points. But beware, colliding with the walls or yourself will end the game!
